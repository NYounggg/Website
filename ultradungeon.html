              <h1>ABOUT</h1>
              <p>
                ULTRADUNGEON is a high-octane dungeon crawler currently in development
                using C# in the Godot game engine. It seeks to combine ideas from rogue-likes, with extraction elements.
                Players will take what loot they have accumulated, and risk it all to take on increasingly challenging dungeons.
                Be careful, as death in these dungeons will cause you to permanently lose whatever gear you brought with you.
              </p>

                ULTRADUNGEON has three main classes: Mage, Ranger and Melee, each with their own sets of gear.
                Players can mix and match weapons, armour and perks to create their own unique builds.
